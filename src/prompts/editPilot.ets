Here is a list of files to edit.

This example shows all possible operations & thier inputs. ONLY use these operation types and arguments, follow it exactly. The line number and startLine should refer to the same line. Be mindful to insert code in the correct place (inside a class 
if it belongs there). With JSX, pay extra attention to where in the tree you are inserting, and get the line number correct. Errors will lead to bad code.

{
  "file/name": <%= props.exampleJson %>
}

Your return format is a JSON object with files as keys and arrays of operations as values. If the edit operations are long or require many changes, you can return the entire file as a string instead of array of operations.Â  
{
  "path/to/file": [edit operations],
  "path/to/newfile": "new file as a string",
  ...
}
