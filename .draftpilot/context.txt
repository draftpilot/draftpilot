This project, named "draftpilot", is an AI-assisted codebase helper built using React for the frontend and Express for the backend. The frontend is styled using Tailwind CSS and can be found in the `src/react` directory, while the backend is powered by Node.js and Express, located in the `src/server` directory. The database used in this project is SQLite3, with its implementation found in the `src/db` directory. The main business logic resides in the `src/directors` folder.

The frontend state management is handled using a library called Nanostores, which provides an `atom<type>` helper with `.set` and `.get` methods. Within the UI components, the `useStore(atomVariable)` hook is used to access the state variables. This allows for a lightweight and efficient state management solution.

Key libraries used in this project include Axios for making HTTP requests, Chalk for terminal output styling, Commander for CLI commands, Dexie for IndexedDB, and Fast-glob for file system operations. The project also utilizes several AI-related libraries, such as GPT-3-encoder and OpenAI, to enhance its AI capabilities. The build process is managed using Vite and ESBuild, with configurations found in `vite.config.ts` and `esbuild.js` files. The `package.json` file contains various scripts for building, testing, and running the application.
